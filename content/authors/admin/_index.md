I am a postdoctoral associate in the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University, working with Professor Li Ma. I obtained my Ph.D. in Statistical Science at University of California, Santa Cruz, where I was very fortunate to be advised by Athanasios Kottas. My dissertation focused on Bayesian nonparametric modeling and inferences for point processes, with an emphasis on seismological application.
